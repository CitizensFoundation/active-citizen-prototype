This is my todo list. Contributions and suggestions don't have to be restricted to these things in any way.

=== Small stuff
* Brood crossover? 
=== Bigger stuff
* More selection algorithms: multiple populations with migration? Niching?
* More builtin genotypes:
  * Tree-based, extending into genetic programming. mostly done. add option for ADFs? Cartesian GP?
* Extend benchmarking options:
  * Extend dsl to have options for manual test cases given by sel/cross/mut/etc options, or even free code blocks.
  * Option to compare several generation/population size settings. Especially both of them together while keeping the number of fitness evaluations roughly constant.
  * Detailed stats for use in comparing a small number of strategies? graphs?
